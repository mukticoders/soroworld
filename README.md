# Solar System Orrery

Welcome to our Solar System Orrery project, created as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge! This interactive, 3D, static solar system model allows users to explore and learn about our planetary system in an engaging and intuitive way.

## Features

### üåå Clickable Planets
- Each planet in the solar system can be clicked to reveal detailed information about it, including:
  - Name
  - Size
  - Distance from the Sun
  - Unique features

### üåç 3D Models
- The orrery features realistic 3D models of planets.
- Planets are rotatable, providing a dynamic viewing experience.

### üåÄ Multi-Directional Viewing
- Users can view the solar system from various angles and directions to better understand planetary positions and scales.

### üöÄ Educational Focus
- The project aims to make learning about the solar system accessible and fun for all ages.

## Technologies Used

### üíª Frontend Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Ensures robust, type-safe code for better maintainability.
- **JavaScript**: Provides dynamic interactions and functionality.
- **HTML**: Forms the structure of the orrery.
- **CSS**: Adds styling to create an immersive space-themed user interface.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-system-orrery
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to explore the solar system.

   - Alternatively, you can host the project on a local development server (e.g., using VS Code Live Server).

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Click on any planet to display detailed information.
3. Rotate the planets or change the viewing angle for a multi-directional perspective.
